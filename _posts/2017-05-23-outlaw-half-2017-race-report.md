I should have been writing my race report today, as an Outlaw, but alas this was not meant to be, so how about a race report from the other side of the finishing chute?
I travelled down with Lottie, who was her usual bright bubbly self, until we hit about 3 miles outside of Nottingham. I think it was when we started seeing brown signs for PierrePoint making her realise the enormity of the task she'd set herself. Or maybe it was just the thoughtâ€‹ of camping in torrential rain?
It has been a long time since I've properly camped, and I'd never seen the tent I'd borrowed out of the bag, so I was building it blind, desperate to get out of the increasing rain.
Once the tent was sorted, it was off to the pub for tea and catch up with the rest of the WTC crew. It was strange how alone I felt in a crowded room at that point. Everyone was excited and talking race prep, nutrition strategies and training anecdotes. It feels so long since I've actually trained and even longer since I've trained with the club that I felt an imposter amongst these athletes. Obviously I am super proud of each and every one of them for the work they've done to get them to this point, but the combination of non-training blues and jealousy put me in a strange headspace.
A cold and noisy night, combined with a stupidly early start was slightly redeemed by the combination of Charlotte's kettle and a packet of coffee. I did what I could to keep Lottie calm (I didn't have any prosecco though), and I wished all the gang good luck as they made their way to rack up, still wishing it was me going with them.
There wasn't much time to mope as we needed to set off to set up the first feed station on the bike route and the first rider was due at 730. 
It wasn't until Greg pulled up with the kit van that I truly realised the amount of organising this event takes. Packed with bottles, filled and empty, bananas, gels, tables, bottle drop and, of course, the crew t-shirts, a lot of time and energy goes into making things run smoothly. Greg let us know what was needed and everyone pitched in to get everything in place. Like a well oiled machine, we were all set up by 715, ready for a briefing and demo about how to hold the bottles and then we were all ready, all we needed were riders.
The first guys went through like bullets, hardly acknowledging we were there, but as the morning progressed we got busier and busier, handing out bottles and snacks, filling empties, holding bikes whilst athletes disappeared into the porta-loos, helping with basic mechanical repairs, shaking cow bells and generally having fun. I spent a great deal of time, literally elbow deep in High5, so if you were unfortunate enough to get an arm hair in your bottle, I'm really sorry. 
It was towards the back of the field that the real heroes were. Each tired face told a story of suffering and determination. It was these grateful people who made "working" on the feed station worthwhile, and who provided so much inspiration (although if I could go as fast as the leaders, I'd take that too).
All too soon the last rider came through and it was time to clear down. It felt like we'd done a full shift, which we had, but we were still able to get to the finish line to cheer most of our athletes home.
There was a great atmosphere in the main arena, lots of happy tired people finishing and lots of love and support for the hardy souls still out there. The music was pumping, the commentator was gee-ing everyone up, brilliant. I have to admit to being a bit emotional at times, mainly watching the runners go down the red chute hand in hand with their children. As was pointed out at the pre-race briefing, triathlon training isn't a one person activity. Most people have friends and family to support them, spending 12+ hours a week (much more for some people) away from the family isn't possible without their support, so it's lovely to be able to share the glory. I think it was at these points I was at my lowest. Of course I was happy for the families running down the chute, but I'd missed out on doing that with my girls, and that was hard.
As the cut-off time for the bike leg drew closer, we were still waiting for two WTC athletes. An announcement was made saying that all remaining riders on course were nearby and it was looking like nobody would miss the cut off, but until I saw everyone, I couldn't shake the sick feeling in my stomach. When Andy rolled round the corner & Lottie a little later I was so happy for them, knowing how they both felt about the bike leg, it was good to see them in the transition area, then even better so see them up and running, but totally amazing to see them over that finish line at the end.
Every single athlete who started that race is now a hero of mine. I'm still struggling to come to terms with my not being able to race, and I'm suffering, mentally, with the cessation of training blues, but this weekend has shown me that the only thing stopping me being an Outlaw is me, and I will be an Outlaw.
